# Bot Battlr

**Bot Battlr** is a React web application where users can browse a collection of bots, enlist them into their army, and even discharge bots from service! It's a fun little game where you manage your own army of robots, view their stats, and delete them from your army if you no longer need them. Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, the app features a sleek dark theme for ultimate space vibes!
